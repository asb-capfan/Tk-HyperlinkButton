Tk-HyperlinkButton
==================

This Perl/Tk widget provides an hyperlink widget. That is, a button
with a slightly changed look and feel, and a default method to open
the desired target URL in a web browser.

This is useful if you want just quickly want to embedd clickable
hyperlinks in your Perl/Tk application.
Otherwise, you would have to code the UI behavior as well as the
open-in-browser part over and over again.
